Franklyn decides the following:
"Fuck coding, I'm going to become a magician"

After 2 weeks he returns to show off his magic act.
Nisha volunteers for his act.

He places Nisha into a soundproof box and cuts the box into 3 pieces.
He switches the tail ends to show that the box has actually been cut into pieces.

When he opens the boxes the horror ensues. Blood everywhere.

When we act quickly we might be able to sow Nisha back together
in order to make everything ok.

Write a function that takes Nisha's feet, torso and head and puts them back in the
correct order: head, torso, feet.

It should take other inputs as well. Just switch the first item in the array with
the third

function switcheroo(arr) {

}

console.log(switcheroo(['Feet','Torso','Head']))
// outputs [ 'Head', 'Torso', 'Feet' ]
console.log(switcheroo(['Last item', 'Center item', 'First item' ]))
// outputs [ 'First item', 'Center item', 'Last item' ]
